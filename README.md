# Water

> water your terrarium with data

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have `Node` and `npm` installed to run this project. You can install them both [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), since `npm` comes with `Node`. You'll want to make sure you have the following versions:

```
node > v8
npm > 5
```

This shouldn't be a problem if you are just downloading `Node` for the first time.

### Installing

To install, simply clone this repo, `cd` into the directory, and run:

```
$ npm install
```

followed by

```
$ npm run water
```
